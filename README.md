# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project builds a predictive system to detect the presence of **heart disease** using multiple machine learning algorithms.  
The models are compared using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**, along with a performance visualization.

## 📁 Dataset
- **Source:** [UCI Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/processed.cleveland.data)  
- **Total Attributes:** 13 features + target variable  
- **Target:**  
  - `1` → Patient has heart disease  
  - `0` → No heart disease

## 📌 Feature Descriptions (and Their Importance)

| Feature       | Description | Medical Importance |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **age**       | Patient’s age in years | Risk of heart disease increases with age. |
| **sex**       | Gender (1 = male, 0 = female) | Men are generally at higher risk earlier than women. |
| **cp**        | Chest pain type (0–3) | Indicates angina type; typical angina is a strong risk indicator. |
| **trestbps**  | Resting blood pressure (mm Hg) | High BP is a significant risk factor for heart disease. |
| **chol**      | Serum cholesterol (mg/dl) | High cholesterol leads to arterial blockage and heart disease. |
| **fbs**       | Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false) | Diabetes and high sugar levels increase heart risk. |
| **restecg**   | Resting electrocardiographic results (0–2) | Detects abnormalities in heart rhythm or size. |
| **thalach**   | Maximum heart rate achieved | Lower values may indicate poor heart function. |
| **exang**     | Exercise induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no) | Angina during exercise suggests blocked arteries. |
| **oldpeak**   | ST depression induced by exercise | Measures heart stress; higher depression indicates risk. |
| **slope**     | Slope of the ST segment (0–2) | Related to exercise ECG results; abnormal slopes indicate issues. |
| **ca**        | Number of major vessels (0–3) colored by fluoroscopy | Higher count usually correlates with less blockage. |
| **thal**      | Thalassemia test (3 = normal, 6 = fixed defect, 7 = reversible defect) | Detects blood and oxygen flow abnormalities. |
| **target**    | Heart disease presence (1 = disease, 0 = no disease) | Label for prediction. |
